## Headings 

To create a heading, add one or more hash (#) symbols before the text. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading. 

`# heading one`

`###### heading six`

For example:



## Lists

To create a list, start each item with an asterisk (*), hyphen (-), or plus sign (+). You can also create nested lists by indenting items with spaces or tabs. For example:

` - Apple`

` -  Banana `

` - Papaya `


## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in square brackets [] and the URL in parentheses (). For example:

`[title](https://www.example.com)`

## Bold and Italics

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. For example:

` **Bold**`

`*Italiczed*`

## images

o insert an image, use an exclamation mark (!), followed by a description of the image in square brackets. Then, add the image's location or web address in parentheses. Optionally, you can add a title in quotation marks after the location or web address. For example: 

`
![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")`


## Code Block

To add a code block , put a code inside a pair of backtits

`Hello This is code block`
